It is nice to have you here.

This Chrome Extension was created in the beginning of 2025 when my partner, Dafne, was expressing the agony behind a repetitive daily task in her vocation.
Naturally, I have ideas run through my head of this:
  What can I make for her that will make her life easier in the moments of her day that this task comes up. 

What is this task? 
  
  Material Scheduling

You design the place that someone calls their Home. 
Through the process of changing this space, no matter the size of the job, materials needed for this home will need to be scheduled. 

Spreadsheets spreadsheets spreadsheets
  They can be tedious as you fill out the schedules for obtaining the necessary materials for the home redesign. 


If you know someone in the industry, I hope this can help them with their time spent filling out spreadsheets.
